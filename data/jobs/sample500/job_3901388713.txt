Title: Financial Analyst
Experience Level: Associate
Work Type: Full-time
Description: We are looking for a dynamic, experienced Financial Analyst to join our fast-growing dental partnership network’s (“DPN”) Accounting team. Guardian Dentistry Partners’ mission is to support our partner dentist entrepreneurs and teams in building the practices of their dreams. While Guardian brings together passionate, purpose-driven, like-minded dental entrepreneurs who share similar values, each of our partners are very different, and it’s those very differences that make us stronger in positively impacting the lives of everyone we serve across our network of practices. Guardian Dentistry Partners works alongside dental groups that are founded and operated by successful dentist entrepreneurs. Our local partnerships consist of dentist owners/partners in key leadership positions, and with that you get a de-corporatized setting while still benefiting from economies of scale. Like our leadership team, the dentist entrepreneurs that have joined Guardian recognize the value of more resources whilst preserving their autonomy, identity, and culture. We embrace each practices’ unique culture and strive to preserve everything about what makes the practice so special while also providing for a pathway for careful and thoughtful evolution and growth, all the while ensuring the highest standards of patient care.
